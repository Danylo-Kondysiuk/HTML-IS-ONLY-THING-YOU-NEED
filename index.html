   <h1>HTML is only the thing you need to make a Website</h1> 
   <p>IT IS THE PERFECT WEBSITE!</p>
   <h2>Seriously, what more do you need?</h2>

   <ul>
        <li>It's lightweight and quick to load.</li>
        <li>It adapts seamlessly to all devices.</li>
        <li>It maintains consistency across all browsers.</li>
        <li>It's accessible to every visitor.</li>
        <li>It's clear, legible, and effectively conveys your message.</li>
   </ul>

   <h3>Let’s get real:</h3>
   <p>You are over-designing. Look at this site. It’s a website. Why include an animated banner flag on hover? 
    You invested hours and added 80 kilobytes to your site, but someone tapping on it with thick fingers will never notice.
     Moreover, visually impaired users won’t experience that, nor do they notice any of your excessive embellishments.</p>

    <p>Unbeknownst to you, this is your perfect website. Here’s why:</p>
    <hr />
    <h4>It’s lightweight.</h4>

    <p>This entire page is lighter than the gradient-meshed Facebook logo on your Wordpress site. 
        Did you really load 100kb of jQuery UI just to animate a div's background color? 
        You included all 7 font faces of a web font to say “Hi.” in 100px height at the start of your site? <br />
        Really?</p>

    <hr />

    <h4>It’s responsive.</h4>
<p>You assumed media queries were essential for responsiveness, but no.
     Responsive design means adapting to any screen size.
      This site doesn’t care if you’re on an iMac or a Tamagotchi.</p>
    <hr />

    <h4>It works.</h4>
    <p>Look at this. You can read it ... assuming you can read. It’s logical. It has structure. 
        It uses HTML5 tags so you and your browser understand the content. That’s semantics.</p>

        <p>It presents content directly. Your site has three bylines and a link to your Dribbble account, 
            but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click a bouncing button to showcase the jQuery ScrollTo plugin.</p>
